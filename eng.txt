Many developers think of templates as being reusable renderable
pieces of text, such as the capability provided by most template
engines (Mustache, Handlebars, etc.). ES6â€™s use of the word template
would imply something similar, like a way to declare inline template
literals that can be re-rendered. However, that's not at all the right
way to think about this feature.

So, before we go on, I'm renaming it to what it should have been
called: interpolated string literals (or interpoliterals for short).

You're already well aware of declaring string literals with " or *
delimiters, and you also know that these are not smart strings (as
some languages have), where the contents would be parsed for inter-
polation expressions.

However, ES6 introduces a new type of string literal, using the *
backtick as the delimiter. These string literals allow basic string

interpolation expressions to be embedded, which are then automati-
cally parsed and evaluated.
